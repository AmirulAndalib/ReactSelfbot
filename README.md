## Yes, for real

# Props to [@ReactDev1337](https://github.com/ReactDev1337/ReactSelfbot)

## ⚠ Python 3.10+ not supported ⚠

### Why am I making this open source?
Because can't stop calling my product a rat, tokenlogger and what else not.

### But there is "skidded code"
I've got some dictionaries and code from Sherlock, because how am I supposed to implement Sherlock without adding code from it :WeirdChamp:

### Before someone says "it's pasted"
Every single selfbot is pasted and every discord.py command looks the same, now shut up

### Will this be the next Alucard?
Yes, definetly.

### How to compile/use?
I will release a compiled version. If you don't know how to compile it, don't.

### Can I skid this, I mean it's open source?
If you do, I will make sure everyone knows its from me :)

### Will you publish the Authentication/Dashboard/Website?
No I won't, because it's gonna make it easier for other pastes.

### You forgot something XXX is missing
I don't care.

### OS Support
The selfbot works on Windows, Linux (x64_x86/ARMv7) and should work on MacOS (Not tested)

### Note
This version has some changes since the last version from https://reactselfbot.pro/

### Contributing (I know you won't)
Feel free to contribute I will merge it if it's good or removes some of my code i haven't removed which is no longer used.

### Legal stuff
This thing can get your account banned blah blah blah, you know it, it's against Discord ToS, use at your own risk, this is for educational purposes only.

# Licensing
I'm gonna put this under a license which won't allow other products to publish closed source variants of this, even though I know skids like Nighty, Ragnarok will still do it.
